FARM LAYOUT:
Polygon corners (approximate GPS coordinates):

Top (N) (tree 1): 37.366449, -120.423065

Right (E) (tree 5): 37.366273, -120.422867

Left (W) (tree 21): 37.366288, -120.423292

Bottom (S) (tree 25): 37.366118, -120.423083

Grid size:

5 trees per row

5 trees per columns (aisle)

Total trees: 5 Ã— 5 = 25 trees

RULES:

Numbering: ONE-BASED INDEXING NOT ZERO INDEX, ordered left-to-right, top-to-bottom (like reading a book) for all trees. i.e tree 1 is row 1, column 1.
Tasks should almost always require driving to a tree and then doing an action unless doing multiple actions at the same tree.
